# Real-Time Gyroscope Precession Simulation

This project is a **Real-Time Gyroscope Precession Simulation** that provides an interactive interface to visualize and understand gyroscopic precession dynamics. The application uses Python's **Tkinter** for GUI design and **Matplotlib** for 2D and 3D visualizations.

---

## Features

### üåÄ **Interactive Simulation**
- Adjust the gyroscope's **spin rate** (RPM) and **applied torque** (N¬∑m) using sliders.
- Real-time updates to the gyroscopic behavior and associated plots.

### üìä **Data Visualization**
- **Torque vs Precession** and **Precession vs Time** live-updating plots.
- A 3D gyroscope visualization that rotates dynamically based on user input.

### üìÇ **Data Logging and Reporting**
- Tracks simulation data such as time, torque, and precession angle.
- Displays historical data in a tabular format.
- Generates a statistical report and saves data as a CSV file for further analysis.

### üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface**
- Modern, styled GUI with tooltips, real-time labels, and smooth interactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
  ```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gyroscope-simulation.git
cd gyroscope-simulation
```

---

## Usage

### Run the Application
```bash
python gyroscope_simulation.py
```

### Adjust Controls
- Use sliders to set **spin rate** (RPM) and **torque** (N¬∑m).
- Click **Pause** to stop or resume the simulation.
- Click **Reset** to clear the simulation data.

### Generate Reports
- Click the **Generate Report** button to view and save a summary of simulation data.

### Visualization
- Observe real-time updates in the plots and the 3D gyroscope visualization.

## How It Works

- **Gyroscope Dynamics**: Precession angle is updated based on torque and angular velocity.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Updates plots and visualizations every 10ms.
- **Data Logging**: Tracks historical data and maintains it in a tree-view table.
